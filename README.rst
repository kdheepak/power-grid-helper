Quickstart
----------

First, set your app's secret key as an environment variable. For example, example add the following to ``.bashrc`` or ``.bash_profile``.

.. code-block:: bash

    export POWER_GRID_HELPER_SECRET='something-really-secret'


Then run the following commands to bootstrap your environment.


::

    git clone https://github.com/kdheepak89/power_grid_helper
    cd power_grid_helper
    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
    python manage.py server

You will see a pretty welcome screen.

Once you have installed your DBMS, run the following to create your app's database tables and perform the initial migration:

::

    python manage.py db init
    python manage.py db migrate
    python manage.py db upgrade
    python manage.py server
